#Absolutely necessary (even if empty) if you don't want an error.
# Our Sections nodes have references to Codes, so we want those to be
# imported first. We make that dependency explicit here - by putting those
# migrations under the 'required' key, we ensure that the tools will prevent
# us from running the sections migration unless the  codes
# migrations are complete (although we can override the dependency check by
# passing --force to the drush migrate-import command). We can also add
# 'optional' dependencies - these affect the order in which migrations are
# displayed, and run by default, but does not force you run them in that
# order.
# The general rule of thumb is that any migrations referenced by migration
# process plugins should be required here.
